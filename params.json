{"name":"About Me","tagline":"NickolasTheGreek","body":"### Who am I?\r\nMy name is... Well, you can call me Nick. I am a software developer/hacker/hobbyist engineer/a lot of other made up titles. I am also the lead programmer behind 'The Island', but that's not made up. You should play it, it's a pretty fun game! :) Back on topic. \r\n\r\n### My programming style\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid main()\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat's right! If you code like the following example, you do not belong here.\r\n```\r\nvoid main(){\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Programming languages I can hello-world in\r\n* -C# (I can do all sorts of stuff in C#, ranging from games to neural network simulation.)\r\n* -Java (Pretty much the same.)\r\n* -C/C++ (Meh, I can do more than a simple hello world and less than a game engine)\r\n* -Python (Pretty basic stuff.)\r\n* -BASIC (I write dem codez da best!)\r\n* -HTML (What's a frame?)\r\n* -LEDA (Never heard of it? That's probably because I created it... Yup, I made a compiler, too!)\r\n\r\n### My age\r\nToo young to be able to (legally) work/drive, too old to play with action figures.\r\n\r\n### My interests\r\n* -Programming (Well, duh!)\r\n* -Video Games (Who doesn't like them?)\r\n* -Books (I'm cool, I swear!)\r\n* -Table Tennis (I can hold a paddle.)\r\n* -Electrical Engineering (A breadboard? Never heard of it!)\r\n* -Hacking (I can launch IDA and also quit it.)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
